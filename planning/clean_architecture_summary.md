## 🎯 **Key Business Logic Extraction Points**

### **High-Priority Extractions**
1. **Certificate Management Logic** (Fastfile lines 60-180)
   - Apple Developer Portal certificate limits (2 dev, 3 dist max)
   - Certificate validation and team matching
   - Cleanup strategies when at limits
   - P12 import and export workflows

2. **Version Management Logic** (Fastfile lines 350-420 + deploy.sh lines 600-700)
   - Semantic versioning with conflict resolution
   - TestFlight build number synchronization
   - Marketing version vs build number relationships

3. **Deployment Orchestration** (Entire Fastfile workflow)
   - Multi-step deployment coordination
   - Error handling and recovery strategies
   - Success confirmation and status reporting

### **Complex Business Rules to Preserve**
- **Apple Certificate Limits**: Strict enforcement of Apple's certificate limits
- **Profile-Certificate Matching**: Complex algorithms for profile compatibility
- **Version Conflict Resolution**: Intelligent conflict detection and resolution
- **Upload Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff with circuit breaker patterns
- **Team Collaboration Rules**: Multi-developer certificate sharing strategies
