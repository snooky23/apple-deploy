- `attempt_certificate_remediation` with intelligent error resolution
- Integration with build_and_upload as Step 2.5 (pre-build validation)

**Validation Criteria:**
- Validates actual certificate accessibility (not just presence)
- Tests real codesign tool access with team certificates
- Automatic remediation resolves common certificate issues
- Prevents build failures by catching issues before building

  - Team certificate consistency validation
  - TEAM_INFO.txt staleness checking
- `backup_existing_certificates` with timestamped backups
- `recreate_fresh_certificates` with force_create capability
- `cleanup_old_certificates_from_keychain` for team-specific removal

**Validation Criteria:**
- Detects certificates expiring within 30 days
- Identifies provisioning profiles older than 7 days
- Creates timestamped backups before any changes
- Successfully recreates fresh certificates and exports for team
