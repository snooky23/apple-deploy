## 🤝 Team Collaboration

### New Team Member Setup (5 minutes)
*For developers joining an existing team with shared certificates*

```bash
# 1. Install apple-deploy and get project
brew tap snooky23/tools && brew install apple-deploy
git clone your-team-ios-project && cd your-app

# 2. Initialize and import team certificates
apple-deploy init
# Copy shared team credentials to apple_info/

# 3. Deploy immediately - it just works!
apple-deploy deploy \
    apple_info_dir="./apple_info" \
    team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
    app_identifier="com.yourteamapp" \
    apple_id="your@email.com" \
    api_key_id="YOUR_KEY_ID" \
    api_issuer_id="your-issuer-uuid" \
    app_name="Your App" \
    scheme="YourScheme"
```

### Team Lead Initial Setup (one-time)
*For the first person setting up certificates for the entire team*

```bash
# 1. Install and initialize team project
brew tap snooky23/tools && brew install apple-deploy
cd your-team-app && apple-deploy init

# 2. Create and export team certificates
apple-deploy deploy \
    apple_info_dir="./apple_info" \
    team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
    app_identifier="com.yourteamapp" \
    apple_id="your@email.com" \
    api_key_id="YOUR_KEY_ID" \
    api_issuer_id="your-issuer-uuid" \
    app_name="Your Team App" \
    scheme="YourScheme"

# 3. Share apple_info/ directory with team
# Team members copy the apple_info/ folder to their projects
```

### Why This Team Approach Works
- ✅ **One-time certificate setup** by team lead creates shared P12 files
- ✅ **5-minute onboarding** for any new team member 
- ✅ **Cross-machine compatibility** - certificates work on any Mac
- ✅ **Shared Apple Developer account** - no individual accounts needed
- ✅ **Team isolation** - complete separation between different teams/projects

## 🔄 Intelligent Build System

### 3-Attempt Failover Strategy
The platform uses intelligent build logic that automatically resolves common signing issues:

**Attempt 1: Automatic Signing** ⚡
- Lets Xcode handle signing automatically
- Fastest approach for properly configured projects

**Attempt 2: Manual Signing with Smart Matching** 🧠
- Automatically switches to manual signing
- Intelligently matches certificate types to profile types:
  - AppStore profiles → Distribution certificates
  - Development profiles → Development certificates
- Configures Xcode project with correct certificate/profile pairs

**Attempt 3: Certificate Mismatch Recovery** 🔧
- Detects "doesn't include signing certificate" errors
- Analyzes keychain for available certificates
- Automatically reconfigures project with correct certificate
- Updates project.pbxproj directly if needed

### What This Solves
- ✅ **Certificate Type Mismatches**: AppStore profiles matched with development certificates
- ✅ **"Provisioning profile required" errors**: Automatic project configuration
- ✅ **"Doesn't include signing certificate" errors**: Smart certificate selection
- ✅ **Manual intervention**: Complete automation of signing configuration

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnosis
```bash
# Test your environment before deployment
apple-deploy status \
    apple_info_dir="/path/to/secure/apple_info" \
    team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
    app_identifier="com.yourapp"
```

### Common Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 "API key file not found" Error</strong></summary>

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Check your API key path
ls -la /path/to/secure/apple_info/YOUR_TEAM_ID/AuthKey_*.p8

# If not found, move it to the right location
mv ~/Downloads/AuthKey_*.p8 /path/to/secure/apple_info/YOUR_TEAM_ID/
```

**Directory structure should look like:**
```
/path/to/secure/apple_info/
└── YOUR_TEAM_ID/
    ├── AuthKey_XXXXX.p8     ← Must be here
    ├── certificates/
    └── profiles/
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 "App icon is missing" or TestFlight Upload Fails</strong></summary>

**This is the #1 cause of first-time deployment failures!**

Apple requires a proper app icon before TestFlight uploads. The build will fail with errors like:
- "The app bundle does not contain an app icon for iPhone"
- "App icon is missing"
- "Invalid bundle - missing CFBundleIconName"

**Quick Fix:**
1. **Add App Icon to Xcode Project:**
   ```
   YourApp.xcodeproj → Assets.xcassets → AppIcon
   ```

2. **Required Icon Sizes (iOS):**
   - 20x20, 29x29, 40x40, 58x58, 60x60, 76x76, 80x80, 87x87, 120x120, 152x152, 167x167, 180x180, 1024x1024

3. **Quick Solution - Use App Icon Generator:**
   - Visit [appicon.co](https://appicon.co) or similar
   - Upload your 1024x1024 icon
   - Download and drag all sizes into Xcode's AppIcon asset

4. **Verify Icon is Set:**
   ```bash
   # Check your project settings
   apple-deploy status apple_info_dir="./apple_info" team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" app_identifier="com.yourapp"
   ```

**After adding the icon, retry deployment - it should work immediately!** ✅

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 "Missing required apple_info_dir parameter"</strong></summary>

**The apple_info_dir parameter is only required for custom locations.** For local projects, it defaults to `./apple_info`:

```bash
# ✅ Local project (after apple-deploy init) - parameter optional
apple-deploy deploy \
    team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
    app_identifier="com.yourapp" [...]

# ✅ Custom/shared location - specify absolute path  
apple-deploy deploy \
    apple_info_dir="/Users/john/shared_apple_info" \
    team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" [...]
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 TestFlight upload fails with API key errors</strong></summary>

**This has been resolved in production.** The platform automatically handles xcrun altool API key location requirements:

1. Copies your API key to `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/`
2. Runs the upload command
3. Cleans up the temporary API key copy

**No action required** - this works automatically.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ "Version already exists on TestFlight"</strong></summary>

**The platform prevents this automatically** by checking TestFlight for the latest build number and incrementing appropriately.

**Manual version control:**
```bash
# Force version increment
apple-deploy deploy \
    apple_info_dir="./apple_info" \
    version_bump="patch" \
    team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" [...]
```
</details>

### Still Having Issues?

**Enable detailed logging:**
```bash
DEBUG_MODE=true VERBOSE_MODE=true \
    apple-deploy deploy apple_info_dir="./apple_info" [...]

# Check the generated log file
cat build/logs/deployment_*.log
```

## 🛡️ v2.12.3 Technical Implementation Notes

### Certificate Trust Fix
**PROBLEM SOLVED:** "Invalid trust settings. Restore system default trust settings for certificate" errors

#### What Was the Issue?
CI/CD environments often failed with certificate trust errors during code signing, even when certificates were valid and properly imported.

#### Universal Solution Implemented
- **Generic certificate trust permissions** via `security set-key-partition-list`
- **Works with ANY keychain path** and ANY certificates
- **CI/CD compatible** - completely non-interactive operation  
- **Emergency keychain cleanup** - prevents accumulation in failed deployments
- **Bulletproof error handling** - graceful degradation if trust setting fails

#### Code Location
- **Core Implementation**: `scripts/domain/use_cases/setup_keychain.rb:283-302`
- **Integration Point**: Runs automatically after keychain creation
- **Zero Configuration** - works out of the box for all projects and teams

**Result**: Universal fix that resolves certificate trust issues across all iOS projects, certificate types, and CI/CD environments.
