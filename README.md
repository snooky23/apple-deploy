## 🚀 What's New in v2.12.7

### 🔧 **FINAL FIX: Version Display Accuracy**
**PROBLEM SOLVED:** Fastfile displays incorrect version numbers (1.0.0, build 1) instead of actual project values

**FIXED ISSUES:**
- ✅ **Enhanced project file detection** - robust multi-strategy search for .xcodeproj files
- ✅ **Improved version parsing** - better regex patterns for MARKETING_VERSION and CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION
- ✅ **Working directory diagnostics** - detailed logging shows exactly where files are searched
- ✅ **Robust error handling** - graceful fallback with comprehensive error reporting

**TECHNICAL DETAILS:**
- **Root Cause**: Project file detection failed in Homebrew environment due to working directory assumptions
- **Solution**: Multi-strategy detection (scheme-based → glob pattern → direct file) with detailed logging
- **Result**: Fastfile now correctly displays the same version numbers as the actual IPA build

**How to Upgrade:**
```bash
brew upgrade apple-deploy
```

---

## 🚀 What's New in v2.12.6

### 🔧 **Critical Fix: Project File Detection Enhancement**
**PROBLEM SOLVED:** Fastfile couldn't find project files with different naming patterns, causing version fallback to defaults

**FIXED ISSUES:**
- ✅ **Enhanced project file detection** - tries multiple file path patterns automatically
- ✅ **Robust glob pattern matching** - finds .xcodeproj files regardless of name
- ✅ **Better error diagnostics** - shows exactly which paths were tried when file not found
- ✅ **Universal compatibility** - works with any iOS project structure and naming convention

**TECHNICAL DETAILS:**
- **Root Cause**: Fastfile assumed specific project file naming (./scheme.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj)
- **Solution**: Multi-pattern search including glob patterns for .xcodeproj detection
- **Result**: Automatic version reading works regardless of project file location or name

**How to Upgrade:**
```bash
brew upgrade apple-deploy
```

---

## 🚀 What's New in v2.12.5

### 🔧 **Critical Fix: Version Mismatch Resolution**
**PROBLEM SOLVED:** Deploy.sh updates versions correctly but Fastfile uses wrong version numbers, causing upload conflicts

**FIXED ISSUES:**
- ✅ **Version sync between deploy.sh and Fastfile** - both now read from same Xcode project source
- ✅ **Eliminates "build already exists" false positives** - conflict resolution now uses correct version numbers
- ✅ **Proper project file integration** - Fastfile reads MARKETING_VERSION and CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION directly
- ✅ **Enhanced logging** - shows exactly which version numbers are being used for upload

**TECHNICAL DETAILS:**
- **Root Cause**: Fastfile was using hardcoded fallback values (1.0.0, build 1) instead of reading updated project values
- **Solution**: Direct project.pbxproj parsing in Fastfile to match deploy.sh behavior
- **Result**: 100% version consistency between conflict detection and actual upload

**How to Upgrade:**
```bash
brew upgrade apple-deploy
```

---

## 🚀 What's New in v2.12.4

### 🔥 **Automatic TestFlight Conflict Resolution**
**PROBLEM SOLVED:** "Build number already exists" errors causing deployment failures

**NEW FEATURES:**
- ✅ **Intelligent build conflict detection** - automatically queries TestFlight for existing builds
- ✅ **Zero-config resolution** - automatically increments build numbers when conflicts exist
- ✅ **Integrated with all version strategies** - patch, minor, and major all include conflict resolution
- ✅ **Prevents upload failures** - eliminates "build already exists" errors completely
- ✅ **Smart retry logic** - tries up to 10 different build numbers automatically

**UPGRADE BENEFITS:**
- 🚀 **100% success rate** - no more deployment failures due to build conflicts
- ⚡ **Zero manual intervention** - system handles conflicts automatically
- 🧠 **Intelligent querying** - real-time TestFlight integration via xcrun altool
- 🛡️ **Simplified workflow** - removed confusing sync/auto options, conflict resolution built into patch/minor/major

**How to Upgrade:**
```bash
brew upgrade apple-deploy
```

> **💡 Technical Details:** The system uses `xcrun altool --list-builds` to query existing TestFlight builds and automatically increments build numbers when conflicts are detected. See [Technical Implementation](#-advanced-features) for details.

---

## 🛡️ What's New in v2.12.3

### 🔥 **Universal Certificate Trust Fix**
**PROBLEM SOLVED:** "Invalid trust settings. Restore system default trust settings for certificate" errors in CI/CD environments

**NEW FEATURES:**
- ✅ **Automatic certificate trust configuration** - works silently in the background
- ✅ **Universal CI/CD compatibility** - seamless integration with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.
- ✅ **Zero configuration required** - fix applies automatically to all projects and teams

    apple_info_dir="./apple_info" \
    team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
    app_identifier="com.yourteamapp" \
    apple_id="your@email.com" \
    api_key_id="YOUR_KEY_ID" \
    api_issuer_id="your-issuer-uuid" \
    app_name="Your Team App" \
    scheme="YourScheme"

# 3. Share apple_info/ directory with team
# Team members copy the apple_info/ folder to their projects
```

### Why This Team Approach Works
- ✅ **One-time certificate setup** by team lead creates shared P12 files
- ✅ **5-minute onboarding** for any new team member 
- ✅ **Cross-machine compatibility** - certificates work on any Mac
- ✅ **Shared Apple Developer account** - no individual accounts needed
- ✅ **Team isolation** - complete separation between different teams/projects

## 🧠 Advanced Features

### Smart Version Management with Automatic TestFlight Conflict Resolution
```bash
# Semantic versioning with automatic conflict resolution
apple-deploy deploy apple_info_dir="./apple_info" version_bump="patch" [...]  # 1.0.0 → 1.0.1
apple-deploy deploy apple_info_dir="./apple_info" version_bump="minor" [...]  # 1.0.0 → 1.1.0  
apple-deploy deploy apple_info_dir="./apple_info" version_bump="major" [...]  # 1.0.0 → 2.0.0
```

**🚀 NEW: Automatic Build Number Conflict Resolution**
- ✅ **Intelligent TestFlight checking** - queries existing builds before upload
- ✅ **Zero-config conflict resolution** - automatically increments build numbers when conflicts exist
- ✅ **Works with all version_bump types** - patch, minor, and major all include conflict resolution
- ✅ **Prevents upload failures** - no more "build already exists" errors

**How it works:**
1. Increment version according to your chosen strategy (patch/minor/major)
2. Automatically check TestFlight for existing builds with that version
3. If build number conflicts exist, automatically increment until finding an available number
4. Upload with guaranteed unique version + build combination

**Example automatic resolution:**
```bash
# You request: version 1.0.5, build 32
# TestFlight has: builds 32, 33, 34 for version 1.0.5
# System resolves: automatically uses build 35
# Result: Upload succeeds with version 1.0.5 build 35
```

### Enhanced TestFlight Mode
```bash
# Standard upload (fast) - 3-5 minutes total
apple-deploy deploy apple_info_dir="./apple_info" [...]

# Enhanced mode - wait for Apple processing completion  
apple-deploy deploy apple_info_dir="./apple_info" testflight_enhanced="true" [...]

# Check TestFlight status anytime
apple-deploy status apple_info_dir="./apple_info" team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" app_identifier="com.yourapp"
```

**Enhanced Mode Features:**
- ⏱️ Upload duration tracking with performance metrics
- 🔄 Real-time processing status monitoring
- 📊 Build history display (last 5 TestFlight builds)
- 📝 Advanced audit logging in config.env
- ✅ Processing confirmation until "Ready to Test"

## 🔄 Intelligent Build System

### 3-Attempt Failover Strategy
The platform uses intelligent build logic that automatically resolves common signing issues:

**Attempt 1: Automatic Signing** ⚡
- Lets Xcode handle signing automatically
- Fastest approach for properly configured projects

**Attempt 2: Manual Signing with Smart Matching** 🧠
- Automatically switches to manual signing
- Intelligently matches certificate types to profile types:
  - AppStore profiles → Distribution certificates
  - Development profiles → Development certificates
- Configures Xcode project with correct certificate/profile pairs

**Attempt 3: Certificate Mismatch Recovery** 🔧
- Detects "doesn't include signing certificate" errors
- Analyzes keychain for available certificates
- Automatically reconfigures project with correct certificate
- Updates project.pbxproj directly if needed

### What This Solves
- ✅ **Certificate Type Mismatches**: AppStore profiles matched with development certificates
- ✅ **"Provisioning profile required" errors**: Automatic project configuration
- ✅ **"Doesn't include signing certificate" errors**: Smart certificate selection
- ✅ **Manual intervention**: Complete automation of signing configuration

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Quick Diagnosis
```bash
# Test your environment before deployment
apple-deploy status \
    apple_info_dir="/path/to/secure/apple_info" \
    team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
    app_identifier="com.yourapp"

# Test privacy validation specifically
apple-deploy validate scope="privacy" scheme="YourScheme"
```

### Common Issues

<details>
<summary><strong>🔒 Privacy Validation Issues (NEW!)</strong></summary>

**The most common cause of TestFlight upload failures in iOS apps**

**🚨 ITMS-90683 Error: Missing purpose string in Info.plist**
```
Your app's code references one or more APIs that access sensitive user data. 
The Info.plist file should contain a NSSpechRecognitionUsageDescription key 
with a user-facing purpose string explaining clearly and completely why your 
app needs the data.
```

**✅ IMMEDIATE FIX:**
```bash
# 1. Run privacy validation to see exactly what's missing
apple-deploy validate scope="privacy" scheme="YourApp"

# 2. Add missing keys to your Info.plist in Xcode:
#    - Right-click Info.plist → Open As → Property List
#    - Add the missing keys with clear descriptions
```

**📝 EXAMPLE PRIVACY STRINGS:**
```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses the camera to scan documents and capture photos for your profile.</string>

<key>NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses speech recognition to convert voice commands into text for hands-free operation.</string>

<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This app uses your location to show nearby restaurants and provide directions.</string>
```

**🔧 VALIDATION MODES:**
```bash
# Strict mode (stops deployment on privacy issues)
apple-deploy deploy privacy_validation="strict" [...]

# Warning mode (continues with warnings)  
apple-deploy deploy privacy_validation="warn" [...]

# Skip validation (not recommended)
apple-deploy deploy privacy_validation="skip" [...]
```

**📖 PRIVACY KEYS REFERENCE:**
- `NSCameraUsageDescription` - Camera access
- `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` - Microphone access  
- `NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` - Photo library access
- `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` - Location when in use
- `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription` - Speech recognition
- `NSContactsUsageDescription` - Contacts access
- `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` - Face ID authentication
- `NSUserTrackingUsageDescription` - App tracking transparency (iOS 14.5+)

**💡 BEST PRACTICES:**
- Be specific about WHY you need the permission
- Avoid generic phrases like "This app uses your camera"
- Explain the user benefit clearly
- Use friendly, non-technical language
- Test with `apple-deploy validate scope="privacy"` before deployment

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 "API key file not found" Error</strong></summary>

**Quick Fix:**
```bash
# Check your API key path
ls -la /path/to/secure/apple_info/YOUR_TEAM_ID/AuthKey_*.p8

# If not found, move it to the right location
mv ~/Downloads/AuthKey_*.p8 /path/to/secure/apple_info/YOUR_TEAM_ID/
```

**Directory structure should look like:**
```
/path/to/secure/apple_info/
└── YOUR_TEAM_ID/
    ├── AuthKey_XXXXX.p8     ← Must be here
    ├── certificates/
    └── profiles/
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 "App icon is missing" or TestFlight Upload Fails</strong></summary>

**This is the #1 cause of first-time deployment failures!**

Apple requires a proper app icon before TestFlight uploads. The build will fail with errors like:
- "The app bundle does not contain an app icon for iPhone"
- "App icon is missing"
- "Invalid bundle - missing CFBundleIconName"

**Quick Fix:**
1. **Add App Icon to Xcode Project:**
   ```
   YourApp.xcodeproj → Assets.xcassets → AppIcon
   ```

2. **Required Icon Sizes (iOS):**
   - 20x20, 29x29, 40x40, 58x58, 60x60, 76x76, 80x80, 87x87, 120x120, 152x152, 167x167, 180x180, 1024x1024

3. **Quick Solution - Use App Icon Generator:**
   - Visit [appicon.co](https://appicon.co) or similar
   - Upload your 1024x1024 icon
   - Download and drag all sizes into Xcode's AppIcon asset

4. **Verify Icon is Set:**
   ```bash
   # Check your project settings
   apple-deploy status apple_info_dir="./apple_info" team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" app_identifier="com.yourapp"
   ```

**After adding the icon, retry deployment - it should work immediately!** ✅

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 "Missing required apple_info_dir parameter"</strong></summary>

**The apple_info_dir parameter is only required for custom locations.** For local projects, it defaults to `./apple_info`:

```bash
# ✅ Local project (after apple-deploy init) - parameter optional
apple-deploy deploy \
    team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
    app_identifier="com.yourapp" [...]

# ✅ Custom/shared location - specify absolute path  
apple-deploy deploy \
    apple_info_dir="/Users/john/shared_apple_info" \
    team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" [...]
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 TestFlight upload fails with API key errors</strong></summary>

**This has been resolved in production.** The platform automatically handles xcrun altool API key location requirements:

1. Copies your API key to `~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys/`
2. Runs the upload command
3. Cleans up the temporary API key copy

**No action required** - this works automatically.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ "Version already exists on TestFlight"</strong></summary>

**The platform prevents this automatically** by checking TestFlight for the latest build number and incrementing appropriately.

**Manual version control:**
```bash
# Force version increment
apple-deploy deploy \
    apple_info_dir="./apple_info" \
    version_bump="patch" \
    team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" [...]
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 "Invalid trust settings" Certificate Error (FIXED in v2.12.3)</strong></summary>

**Error Message:**
```bash
❌ Invalid trust settings. Restore system default trust settings for certificate 
   "Apple Distribution: Your Name (TEAM_ID)" in order to sign code with it.
```

**What This Means:**
CI/CD environments and some developer machines reject certificates for code signing due to security restrictions, even when certificates are valid.

**✅ AUTOMATICALLY FIXED in v2.12.3:**
- **Universal certificate trust solution** works automatically in background
- **Zero configuration required** - applies to all projects and teams  
- **CI/CD compatible** - completely non-interactive operation
- **Works with all certificate types** - Development, Distribution, Enterprise

**How to Get the Fix:**
```bash
# Upgrade to v2.12.3
brew upgrade apple-deploy

# Verify version
apple-deploy version  # Should show v2.12.7+
```

**Note:** This fix is automatic and requires no configuration. It works silently during certificate setup.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>🚨 "Not in an iOS project directory" Error (FIXED in v2.12.2)</strong></summary>

**Error Message:**
```bash
❌ Error: Not in an iOS project directory
   Please run this command from your iOS project root directory
```

**✅ FIXED in v2.12.2:**
- **Improved project detection** works correctly from any valid iOS project
- **Enhanced working directory handling** prevents location confusion

**How to Get the Fix:**
```bash
# Upgrade to v2.12.2+
brew upgrade apple-deploy

# Test from your iOS project directory
cd /path/to/your-ios-project
apple-deploy help  # Should work without errors
```
</details>

### Still Having Issues?

**Enable detailed logging:**
```bash
DEBUG_MODE=true VERBOSE_MODE=true \
    apple-deploy deploy apple_info_dir="./apple_info" [...]

# Check the generated log file
cat build/logs/deployment_*.log
```
