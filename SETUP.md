## üçé Step 1: Apple Developer Account Setup

### **1.1 Create or Verify Apple Developer Account**

**If you don't have an Apple Developer Account:**

1. **Visit** [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/)
2. **Click** "Enroll" and choose:
   - **Individual**: Personal projects, single developer
   - **Organization**: Team/company projects, multiple developers
3. **Complete enrollment** (requires $99/year payment)
4. **Wait for approval** (typically 24-48 hours)

**If you already have an account:**
- **Sign in** to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/)
- **Verify** you have access to "Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles"

### **1.2 Find and Document Your Team ID**

**Your Team ID is critical - you'll need it for every deployment:**

1. **Sign in** to [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
2. **Click** "Membership" in the sidebar
3. **Locate** your Team ID (10 alphanumeric characters like "ABC1234567")
4. **Document it** - you'll use this in every deployment command

**Alternative locations to find Team ID:**
- **App Store Connect** ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **General** ‚Üí **Team ID**
- **Xcode** ‚Üí **Project Settings** ‚Üí **Team** (shows Team ID in parentheses)

### 1. Multi-Team Directory Setup (Recommended)

Create the production-ready multi-team structure:

```bash
# Create team-based directory structure
mkdir -p /path/to/private_apple_info/YOUR_TEAM_ID/{certificates,profiles}

# Place your API key in the team directory
mv AuthKey_*.p8 /path/to/private_apple_info/YOUR_TEAM_ID/
```

### 2. Deploy with Production-Verified Command

Use the production-tested deployment command:

```bash
cd /path/to/your-app

../scripts/deploy.sh build_and_upload \
  team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
  apple_info_dir="/path/to/private_apple_info" \
  app_identifier="com.yourcompany.app" \
  apple_id="your@email.com" \
  api_key_path="AuthKey_XXXXX.p8" \
  api_key_id="YOUR_KEY_ID" \
  api_issuer_id="your-issuer-uuid" \
  app_name="Your App" \
  scheme="YourScheme"
```

**‚úÖ This command successfully deployed Voice Forms (com.voiceforms) v1.0.257 to TestFlight**

### üöÄ **NEW: Enhanced TestFlight Mode**

```bash
# Enhanced mode with extended confirmation & logging
../scripts/deploy.sh build_and_upload \
  team_id="YOUR_TEAM_ID" \
  testflight_enhanced="true" \
  apple_info_dir="/path/to/private_apple_info" \
  app_identifier="com.yourcompany.app" \
  # ... other parameters
```

**Enhanced Features:**
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Upload Duration Tracking** - See exact upload time and performance
- üîÑ **Real-time Processing Status** - Wait for Apple to process your build  
- üìä **Build History Display** - View last 5 TestFlight builds
- üìù **Advanced Audit Logging** - Comprehensive tracking
- ‚úÖ **Processing Confirmation** - Verify build is "Ready to Test"
- üîÑ **Smart Profile Reuse** - Automatically reuses existing valid provisioning profiles

### 2. Get Your Apple Developer Credentials

You need these from your Apple Developer account:

1. **Team ID**: Found in Apple Developer Account ‚Üí Membership
2. **App Store Connect API Key**: 
   - Go to App Store Connect ‚Üí Users and Access ‚Üí Keys
   - Create a new key with "Developer" role
   - Download the `.p8` file and note the Key ID and Issuer ID
3. **Bundle ID**: Your app's identifier (e.g., `com.yourcompany.yourapp`)

### 3. Place Your API Key

Put your App Store Connect API key in the certificates folder:

```bash
mkdir -p certificates
# Copy your AuthKey_XXXXXX.p8 file to certificates/
```

### 4. Run the Automation

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh build_and_upload
```

That's it! The system will:
- ‚úÖ Query TestFlight for the latest build number
- ‚úÖ Automatically increment to the next build number  
- ‚úÖ Set up certificates and provisioning profiles
- ‚úÖ Build and upload to TestFlight

## Configuration Values Explained

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `APP_IDENTIFIER` | Your app's bundle identifier | `com.yourcompany.yourapp` |
| `APPLE_ID` | Apple Developer account email | `developer@yourcompany.com` |
| `TEAM_ID` | Apple Developer Team ID | `ABC123DEF4` |
| `API_KEY_ID` | App Store Connect API Key ID | `XYZ789ABC1` |
| `API_ISSUER_ID` | App Store Connect API Issuer ID | `12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012` |
| `API_KEY_PATH` | Path to your .p8 API key file | `../certificates/AuthKey_XYZ789ABC1.p8` |
| `APP_NAME` | Display name for your app | `"My Awesome App"` |
| `SCHEME` | Xcode scheme to build | `MyApp` |
| `P12_PASSWORD` | Password for certificate export | `SecurePassword123!` |

## Finding Your Values

### Team ID
1. Go to [Apple Developer Account](https://developer.apple.com/account/)
2. Click "Membership" in the sidebar
3. Your Team ID is listed there

### App Store Connect API Key
1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Users and Access ‚Üí Keys ‚Üí App Store Connect API
3. Create a new key with "Developer" role
4. Download the `.p8` file
5. Note the Key ID and Issuer ID

### Bundle ID
- This is your app's unique identifier
- Format: `com.yourcompany.yourapp`
- Must match what's in your Xcode project

## Troubleshooting

**"Missing required configuration" error:**
- Make sure all required values are set in `config.env`
- Check that the API key file exists at the specified path

**"Could not find API key file" error:**
- Verify the `API_KEY_PATH` points to your `.p8` file
- Make sure the file exists in the certificates folder

**Build number conflicts:**
- The system automatically handles this by querying TestFlight
- If you still get conflicts, wait a few minutes and try again

## Security Note

- Never commit your `config.env` file to git (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- Keep your API key files secure and never share them
- Use strong passwords for P12 certificate export
