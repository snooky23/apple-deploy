# 🏛️ Domain Entities Documentation
**Clean Architecture - Domain Layer Business Logic**

## 📊 Overview

The iOS Publishing Automation Platform has been enhanced with **Clean Architecture** principles, extracting comprehensive business logic into pure domain entities. This document details the three core domain entities that encapsulate all iOS publishing business rules and validation.

---

## 📜 Certificate Entity
**File**: `scripts/domain/entities/certificate.rb` (445 lines)

### 🎯 Business Purpose
Represents Apple Developer Program certificates with comprehensive business rules for limits, expiration, and team management.

### 🔑 Core Business Rules
- **Apple Certificate Limits**: 2 development certificates, 3 distribution certificates per team
- **Expiration Management**: 1-year validity period with renewal strategies
- **Team Ownership**: Certificate association with Apple Developer Team IDs
- **Configuration Matching**: Validation against deployment requirements

### 🧠 Key Business Methods
```ruby
# Business Validation
certificate.expired?                    # Check if certificate has expired
certificate.valid_for_team?(team_id)   # Validate team ownership
certificate.matches_configuration?(config) # Validate against deployment config

# Apple Business Rules
Certificate.at_development_limit?(team_id)     # Check if team has max dev certs
Certificate.cleanup_strategy(certificates)     # Smart cleanup recommendations
Certificate.from_portal_data(portal_response)  # Create from Apple API data
```

### 📋 Business Constants
```ruby
DEVELOPMENT_LIMIT = 2      # Apple limit for development certificates per team
DISTRIBUTION_LIMIT = 3     # Apple limit for distribution certificates per team
VALIDITY_PERIOD_DAYS = 365 # Standard Apple certificate validity
```

### 🧪 Test Coverage
- **File**: `tests/unit/domain/entities/certificate_test.rb` (279 lines)
- **Methods**: 11 comprehensive test methods
- **Coverage**: 95%+ with edge cases and error conditions

## 📱 ProvisioningProfile Entity
**File**: `scripts/domain/entities/provisioning_profile.rb` (600+ lines)

### 🎯 Business Purpose
Represents Apple Provisioning Profiles with advanced business logic for app identifier matching, certificate associations, and device support.

### 🔑 Core Business Rules
- **Wildcard App Identifier Matching**: Complex regex-based validation for `com.company.*` patterns
- **Certificate Association**: Business logic for profile-certificate relationships
- **Device Support**: iOS, tvOS, watchOS, macOS platform compatibility
- **Profile Type Management**: Development vs Distribution profile logic

### 🧠 Key Business Methods
```ruby
# Wildcard Matching Business Logic
profile.covers_app_identifier?("com.myapp.extension")  # Advanced wildcard validation
profile.contains_certificate?(certificate)             # Certificate association check
profile.supports_device?(device_id)                   # Device support validation

# Platform Business Rules
ProvisioningProfile.identifiers_compatible?(profile_id, app_id)  # Cross-platform compatibility
ProvisioningProfile.required_type_for_configuration(config)     # Profile type selection logic
```

### 📋 Platform Support
```ruby
SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = %w[iOS tvOS watchOS macOS]
WILDCARD_PATTERNS = {
  strict: /\A[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\*\z/,      # com.company.*
  flexible: /\A[a-zA-Z0-9.-]*\*.*\z/   # com.*.extension
}
```

### 🧪 Test Coverage
- **File**: `tests/unit/domain/entities/provisioning_profile_test.rb` (695 lines)
- **Methods**: 15 comprehensive test methods
- **Coverage**: 95%+ including complex wildcard matching scenarios

---

## 📋 Application Entity
**File**: `scripts/domain/entities/application.rb` (650+ lines)

### 🎯 Business Purpose
Represents iOS applications with comprehensive metadata management, semantic versioning, and App Store submission validation.

### 🔑 Core Business Rules
- **Bundle Identifier Validation**: Reverse DNS format with Apple compliance checks
- **Semantic Versioning**: Major/minor/patch increment logic with App Store constraints
- **App Store Submission Validation**: Comprehensive readiness checking
- **Team Ownership Management**: Multi-developer team support

### 🧠 Key Business Methods
```ruby
# Bundle Identifier Business Logic
app.valid_bundle_identifier?                    # Apple compliance validation
app.bundle_domain                              # Extract domain (com.company)
app.belongs_to_domain?("com.mycompany")       # Domain ownership check

# Version Management Business Logic
app.increment_marketing_version("minor")       # Semantic version increment
app.compare_version("1.2.4")                  # Version comparison logic
app.ready_for_app_store?                       # Comprehensive submission validation

# Immutable Update Patterns
app.with_marketing_version("2.0.0")           # Return new instance with updated version
app.with_incremented_version("major")         # Immutable version increment
```

### 📋 App Store Business Constants
```ruby
MAX_APP_NAME_LENGTH = 50           # Apple App Store display name limit
MAX_BUILD_NUMBER = 2147483647      # 32-bit signed integer limit
BUNDLE_ID_MAX_LENGTH = 255         # Maximum bundle identifier length
REVERSE_DNS_REGEX = /\A[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*(\.[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9-]*)+\z/
```

### 🧪 Test Coverage
- **File**: `tests/unit/domain/entities/application_test.rb` (699 lines)
- **Methods**: 16 comprehensive test methods
- **Coverage**: 95%+ including App Store validation and versioning edge cases

## 🔗 Entity Relationships

### Certificate ↔ ProvisioningProfile
```ruby
# Business relationship validation
profile.contains_certificate?(certificate)
certificate.valid_for_profile?(profile)
```

### ProvisioningProfile ↔ Application
```ruby
# App identifier compatibility
profile.covers_app_identifier?(application.bundle_identifier)
application.compatible_with_profile?(profile)
```

### Application ↔ Team Management
```ruby
# Team ownership business logic
application.belongs_to_team?(team_id)
certificate.valid_for_team?(application.team_id)
```

---

## 🎯 Business Rule Examples

### Certificate Limit Management
```ruby
# Apple enforces strict certificate limits per team
team_certificates = Certificate.find_by_team("ABC1234567")
development_certs = team_certificates.select(&:development?)

if development_certs.length >= Certificate::DEVELOPMENT_LIMIT
  cleanup_strategy = Certificate.cleanup_strategy(development_certs)
  # Business logic determines which certificates to revoke
end
```

### Wildcard App Identifier Matching
```ruby
# Complex business logic for provisioning profile app ID matching
company_profile = ProvisioningProfile.new(app_identifier: "com.company.*")
app_extensions = [
  "com.company.mainapp",
  "com.company.todaywidget", 
  "com.company.watchapp.extension"
]

compatible_apps = app_extensions.select do |app_id|
  company_profile.covers_app_identifier?(app_id)  # Advanced regex matching
end
```

### App Store Validation Pipeline
```ruby
# Comprehensive business validation for App Store submission
app = Application.new(bundle_identifier: "com.mycompany.app", ...)

validation_result = {
  ready: app.ready_for_app_store?,
  errors: app.app_store_validation_errors,
  version_valid: app.valid_marketing_version?,
  not_preview: !app.marketing_version_preview?
}
```

## 🎨 Design Patterns

### Immutability Pattern
All entities follow immutable update patterns:
```ruby
# Original entity remains unchanged
original_app = Application.new(marketing_version: "1.0.0", ...)
updated_app = original_app.with_marketing_version("2.0.0")

# original_app.marketing_version still "1.0.0"
# updated_app.marketing_version is "2.0.0"
```

### Factory Pattern
```ruby
# Create entities from external data sources
certificate = Certificate.from_keychain_data(keychain_response)
profile = ProvisioningProfile.from_portal_data(apple_api_response)
application = Application.from_config(deployment_config)
```

### Strategy Pattern
```ruby
# Business rule strategies for complex decisions
cleanup_strategy = Certificate.cleanup_strategy(team_certificates)
# Returns strategy object with business logic for certificate management
```

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

### Business Rule Coverage
Every domain entity test focuses on **business rule validation**:
- Apple certificate limits and constraints
- Wildcard pattern matching accuracy
- Semantic versioning increment logic
- App Store submission requirements
- Team ownership and isolation rules

### Edge Case Testing
Comprehensive edge case coverage:
- Invalid input formats
- Boundary conditions (limits, lengths)
- Error conditions and recovery
- Platform-specific business rules

### Production Stability
All domain entity tests run after every code change to ensure:
- Business logic correctness
- No regression in production deployments
- Comprehensive validation of Apple business rules
